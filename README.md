# Weather_prediction_London

This project uses a London weather data set from 1979 to 2020, using five different algorithms to predict the average temperature. Each algorithm uses Bayesian optimization and genetic algorithms for hyperparameter optimization to find the best combination of hyperparameters.


#London daily electricity consumption forecast
Using daily electricity consumption data in the London area from 2011 to 2013, 9 weather parameters are used to predict electricity consumption in the next day.
